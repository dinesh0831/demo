statically typed language
-----------------------
    A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time

dynamically typed language
-------------------------
    A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc.

scripting language
-----------------
    Scripting languages are interpreted within another program. JavaScript is embedded within a browser and interpreted by that browser.

programmed language
-------------------
    Programming languages like Java are compiled and not interpreted by another application in the same way.

difference between http1 and http2
-----------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. 
In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource. 
HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.
